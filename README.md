# Voice-Enabled Zoom Bot

The Voice-Enabled Zoom Bot is a powerful application that allows you to interact with Zoom meetings using voice commands. By leveraging speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities, this bot seamlessly converts your voice input into text, processes it using the GPT language model, and delivers spoken responses back to the Zoom meeting.

## Overview

The Voice-Enabled Zoom Bot project enables you to:

- Join Zoom meetings and participate using voice commands.
- Speak to the bot, which will convert your voice input into text.
- Process the text input using the GPT language model for intelligent responses.
- Hear the bot's spoken responses in real-time during the Zoom meeting.

## Requirements

To utilize the Voice-Enabled Zoom Bot, you need:

1. **Zoom Account**: Sign up for a Zoom account to access Zoom meetings and interact with the bot.

2. **Supported Device**: Use a device (computer, laptop, or mobile device) with a microphone and speaker to provide voice input and receive bot responses.

3. **Node.js & npm**: Node.js and npm are required to run the server-side code. You can download them from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

4. **React.js**: React.js is required to run the client-side application. You can learn more about it [here](https://reactjs.org/).

5. **Zoom Bot Integration**: Install the Voice-Enabled Zoom Bot application, which integrates with Zoom to join meetings and facilitate voice interactions.

6. **Microphone Access**: Grant the necessary microphone permissions to the bot application for capturing voice input during the Zoom meeting.

## Installation and Setup

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required npm packages for the server-side code by running `npm install` in the project's root directory.

3. Navigate to the client directory (`cd client`) and install the required npm packages for the client-side code by running `npm install`.

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and fill it with the necessary environment variables (see the `.env.example` file for reference).

5. Create another `.env` file in the `client` directory for client-side environment variables.

6. Start the server using `npm start` in the root directory.

7. In another terminal window, navigate to the `client` directory and start the client-side application using `npm start`.

## Usage

1. **Installation**: Install the Voice-Enabled Zoom Bot application on your device.

2. **Meeting Link**: Obtain the meeting link for the Zoom meeting you wish to join.

3. **Launch the Bot**: Open the Voice-Enabled Zoom Bot application and provide the meeting link.

4. **Join the Meeting**: The bot will join the specified Zoom meeting and be ready to accept your voice commands.

5. **Voice Interaction**: Speak naturally and address the bot with your queries, prompts, or instructions.

6. **Bot Processing**: The bot will convert your voice input into text, process it using the GPT language model, and generate intelligent responses.

7. **Real-time Responses**: Hear the bot's spoken responses during the meeting as it converts the text back into speech.

8. **End of Meeting**: When the meeting concludes, you can exit the meeting as usual.

## Important Considerations

- **Data Usage**: Please be aware that voice data is processed by the bot for converting it into text and generating responses. Ensure that you are comfortable with the processing of your voice data and review the bot's data handling policies.

- **Participant Awareness**: Inform all meeting participants that the Voice-Enabled Zoom Bot is being used and that voice interactions may be recorded for processing.

- **Compliance**: Adhere to all applicable laws, regulations, Zoom's terms of service, and OpenAI's guidelines regarding data usage and the usage of the GPT language model.

Please review OpenAI's documentation and guidelines to ensure that your usage of the GPT language model complies with their policies and terms of service. It's important to respect ethical considerations, privacy rights, and the responsible use of AI technology when utilizing the GPT language model in this project.

Ensure that you handle voice data and any processed text output from the GPT model in a manner that respects the privacy and rights of individuals involved, while complying with relevant laws and regulations.

By using or contributing to this project, you acknowledge and accept the responsibility to handle voice data and GPT output ethically and in compliance with applicable laws, Zoom's terms of service, and OpenAI's guidelines. The project maintainers disclaim any liability arising from the usage of this code.

Please exercise caution, make informed decisions, and consider seeking legal advice when necessary.

## Notice: Project Under Development
